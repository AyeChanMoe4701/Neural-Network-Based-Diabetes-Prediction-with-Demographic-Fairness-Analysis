# Diabetes Prediction with Demographic Fairness Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that develops and evaluates a deep learning model for **diabetes prediction**, with a strong emphasis on **demographic fairness and ethical AI considerations**.  
The project explores model performance across different demographic subgroups to identify potential biases and assess fairness.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is twofold:
1. Build an accurate neural network model for predicting diabetes.
2. Analyze whether the model performs equitably across demographic groups such as **sex** and **age**.

The notebook follows a structured machine learning pipeline, from exploratory data analysis to fairness evaluation, ensuring transparency and responsible AI practices.
